We\nmaintain an overweight to Equities with a\npreference for U.S. Equities relative to the\nrest of the world, and still favor a significant\nallocation to bonds in a well-diversified\nportfolio. We would use any weakness in\nequity markets over the second half of the\nyear as an opportunity to rebalance.",

In the immediate aftermath of\nApril 2, the consensus of economists raised their odds of a U.S. recession to over 60% and\npredictions of stagflation became widespread. Strategists marked down their forecasts for\nstock prices into the low 5000s for the S&P 500 index, as the earnings outlook was\nsharply reduced.\nIn reality, the opposite took hold and happened within a few weeks of the Liberation Day\npanic, the economy and markets began one of the strongest pickups in recent history, not\njust in the U.S. but globally as well. In the latest economic outlook, the Organisation for\nEconomic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) notes “Global growth was more resilient\nthan anticipated in the first half of 2025, especially in many emerging market economies”\nhelped by strong AI-related investment in the U.S. and fiscal support in China.\nAs the robust global earnings picture has shown, the focus on the negative effects of\ntariffs overlooked the sharp turn toward pro-business tax and regulatory policies in the U.S\nand the reaction of the rest of the world to the administration’s geopolitical strategy of\nfocusing on America first. For example, Europe has been forced to pick up the tab for its\nown defense, causing macro stimulus on the continent that has bolstered the euro and\ncaused European Equities to outperform the U.S. markets year-to-date (YTD)."
