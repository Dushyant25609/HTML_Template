The first phase was the Repricing of Risk as longer-dated yields spiked on the back of the much higher than expected tariff rates that were announced in April. Once there was the initial decision to relax the imposition of the tariffs, and some early deals and frameworks were announced, we believed the market would enter a period of Relief. We continued to believe that markets would recover, and no recession was imminent. The Relief phase culminated around May and carried through into early June. This phase removed the roughly 20% drawdown in the S&P 500 and helped propel the mega capitalization Growth sector back into a leadership position. Since June, we have experienced broader leadership across the Large-cap space with Financials, Industrials and even parts of the Utilities sector re-gathering momentum. This month, we are upgrading Industrials to a slight overweight from neutral and Financials to a full overweight from slight overweight. Furthermore, we are downgrading Energy to a full underweight from slight underweight and Healthcare to slight underweight from neutral. These sector changes are based on positive profit momentum and potential policy concerns that could impact earnings particularly in Healthcare. Non-U.S. markets have held their ground but have not increased their outperformance relative to the U.S. from the beginning of the year. Overall, this activity, in our opinion, is a much healthier type of market environment in spite of above-average valuations. \nAdditionally, the Small-cap arena has been closing the gap of its Large-cap under-performance with a strong rally in the last two months. We call this timeframe the Re-examine phase which has produced an Owl type of market. An Owl market is firmly in a bull phase, which includes solid earnings, stable interest rates, improving economic fundamentals for 2026, easy enough financial conditions, a weakish U.S. dollar, with tariff and geopolitical risks at bay. In this phase, the Owl peers around 360 degrees to look for confirmation signs that this type of environment is not fading but increasing in momentum as low expectations are surpassed. We expect the Owl to remain on its high perch through the autumn months. After a brief soft patch in economic data, particularly slower job growth, we believe the fourth and final phase kicks into gear in the next couple of months or so. We call it the Regrowth phase. The core tailwind here is positive momentum in profit growth supported by the new fiscal bill and increasing potential for rate cuts.\nWe maintain our overweight in Equities and preference for the U.S. relative to the rest of the world but believe a neutral stance is warranted in International Equities overall given our weaker dollar stance. We would use weakness on the back of 'soft patch' concerns as a buying opportunity in Equities.

        "heading": "We are slightly overweight U.S. Equities",
        "content": "The U.S. remains our preferred Equity region relative to the rest of the world. Index-level valuations have risen amid a swift equity market recovery from the April lows, but earnings currently remain supportive. The BofA Global Research Earnings Revisions Ratio suggests that the U.S. is the only region where earnings upgrades now outnumber downgrades. Q2 is on track to be the eighth consecutive quarter of YoY profits acceleration for the S&P 500 index. Delays, supply chain disruptions, and dampened demand may start to filter through in future quarters, but we ultimately expect full-year earnings growth in the high single digits for the S&P 500 Index. \nLarge-caps maintain relatively strong fundamentals and have led the recovery from the April 8 low, but leadership remains relatively narrow with much of the gains concentrated in mega-cap Technology stocks. Small-caps have recently gained some momentum and may benefit from future interest rate cuts, though tariff concerns could present headwinds. We emphasize the importance of incorporating both Large-caps and Small-caps in strategic portfolios. \nWhile we believe that secular tailwinds will support Growth over the long term, we emphasize the importance of avoiding overexposure to any one area of the market. Value continues to trade at a relative discount to Growth, and dividend-oriented Value stocks remain attractive. We suggest a balanced approach between Value and Growth for long-term investors. \nFrom a sector perspective, it is important to have Equity exposure across cyclical, interest rate-sensitive and Growth sectors. This month we increase our exposure to Financials on increased activity supported by deregulation and a positive net interest income outlook. The interest rate cuts that the Fed implemented last year, along with a steeper yield curve, can help improve credit risk and default rates going forward, especially in Commercial Real Estate (CRE). Moreover, we anticipate U.S. banks could generate record spread revenue this year even without meaningful loan growth, given the repricing trend in securities portfolios industry wide. We increase exposure to Industrials as capex budgets continue to grow, some uncertainties have been removed, 100% bonus depreciation has been enacted again and infrastructure plans are accelerating compared to recent years. Growth in infrastructure-related investments related to secular growth trends in electric power demand, energy transmission and distribution, data center builds, and next-generation Artificial Intelligence (AI)-focused semiconductor technology that is increasingly power hungry could drive multiyear demand for select growth and cyclical stocks. \nUncertainties pertaining to Healthcare policies and pricing as well as potential tariff impacts across Healthcare subsectors could drive rebalancing in portfolios; therefore, we are reducing exposure and stress subsector selection for Healthcare exposure. We also remain cautious on the Energy sector and lower our exposure. The growing oil supply outlook for 2025 could weigh on oil prices, energy cash flows, and earnings in coming quarters. Our positive outlook for Utilities is based on accelerating electric power demand for the first time since the early 2000s, driven in part by the growth in Generative AI (GAI) and increasing electrification of the economy. While we are constructive on Information Technology (IT) and Communication Services as longer-term thematic trends, we maintain our neutral view in the near term on elevated valuations and the recent rally. We remain cautious on Materials, as demand is weak, and pricing power and potential tariff impacts remain questionable. With interest rate volatility in recent months, we are neutral Real Estate (RE) and prefer being selective in the RE subsectors due to positive fundamentals in some areas of RE but remain cautious about weaker trends in other areas like CRE. The consumer remained resilient throughout the first half given macro volatility, and we continue to see positive consumer spending trends despite some pressure from high prices of specific goods and services. We remain more constructive on the Consumer Discretionary sector and less positive on the more defensive Consumer Staples sector, as inflation is well off the peak of recent years and consumer income growth is solid."

        "heading": "We are neutral Emerging Market Equities:",
        "content": "Emerging Markets (EM) relative valuations still appear attractive, but we continue to expect a wide return dispersion between individual EM countries and regions. Trade-dependent Asian markets should be supported by a reduction in tariff-related uncertainty and appreciation of undervalued exchange rates. The heavyweight China market is likely to benefit from its exposure to leading Growth sectors, though regulatory intervention remains an ongoing risk. Growth in China may also remain constrained by structural headwinds for the RE sector and weak household balance sheets, while stimulus measures so far appear insufficient to provide a significant boost to domestic demand. Smaller markets in Central and Eastern Europe should benefit from increased European Union (EU) fiscal outlays, while market direction in Latin America, the Middle East and Africa is likely to remain broadly tied to the direction of natural resource prices. The structural rise in EM consumer spending remains a big reason why we believe investors should consider maintaining a strategic allocation to EM Equities as appropriate. The emerging world now constitutes around 40% of global personal consumption expenditures (PCE), according to the United Nations, and ongoing convergence with developed economies should support GDP growth and corporate earnings over the longer term. We favor active management when investing in EM, as fundamentals differ across countries based on fiscal capacity, external funding needs, corporate governance and other factors."

We expect European markets to benefit from a major potential fiscal expansion driven by infrastructure and defense spending, on top of attractive relative valuations. Manufacturing-led EU economies nonetheless remain at risk from growing competition from China in key industries. We are slightly overweight Japan Equities. The potential for faster interest rate hikes could represent a headwind for Japan but sustained positive inflation and corporate reforms remain fundamental supports. As aggregate net energy importers, International Developed markets should also be more sensitive to the direction of energy prices. We believe long-term investors should maintain some strategic exposure to International Developed Equities, as appropriate, given that they trade at a discount relative to U.S. Equities, contain more of a balance between Value and Growth sectors, can offer attractive dividend yields, and provide diversification."

Not all recommendations will be in the best interest of all investors.\nAsset allocation, diversification and rebalancing do not ensure a profit or protect against loss in declining markets.\nDividend payments are not guaranteed, and are paid only when declared by an issuer’s board of directors. The amount of a dividend payment, if any, can vary over time.\nInvestments have varying degrees of risk. Some of the risks involved with equity securities include the possibility that the value of the stocks may fluctuate in response to events specific to the companies or markets, as well as economic, political or social events in the U.S. or abroad. Small cap and mid cap companies pose special risks, including possible illiquidity and greater price volatility than funds consisting of larger, more established companies.\nInvesting in fixed-income securities may involve certain risks, including the credit quality of individual issuers, possible prepayments, market or economic developments and yields and share price fluctuations due to changes in interest rates. When interest rates go up, bond prices typically drop, and vice versa. Bonds are subject to interest rate, inflation and credit risks.\nMunicipal securities can be significantly affected by political changes as well as uncertainties in the municipal market related to taxation, legislative changes, or the rights of municipal security holders. Income from investing in municipal bonds is generally exempt from federal and state taxes for residents of the issuing state. While the interest income is tax-exempt, any capital gains distributed are taxable to the investor. Income for some investors may be subject to the Federal Alternative Minimum Tax.\nInvestments in high-yield bonds (sometimes referred to as “junk bonds”) offer the potential for high current income and attractive total return, but involves certain risks. Changes in economic conditions or other circumstances may adversely affect a junk bond issuer’s ability to make principal and interest payments.\nTreasury bills are less volatile than longer-term fixed income securities and are guaranteed as to timely payment of principal and interest by the U.S. government.\nMortgage-backed securities are subject to credit risk and the risk that the mortgages will be prepaid, so that portfolio management may be faced with replenishing the portfolio in a possibly disadvantageous interest rate environment.\nInvestments in foreign securities (including ADRs) involve special risks, including foreign currency risk and the possibility of substantial volatility due to adverse political, economic or other developments. These risks are magnified for investments made in emerging markets.\nInvestments in a certain industry or sector may pose additional risk due to lack of diversification and sector concentration.\nInvestments in real estate securities can be subject to fluctuations in the value of the underlying properties, the effect of economic conditions on real estate values, changes in interest rates, and risk related to renting properties, such as rental defaults.\nThere are special risks associated with an investment in commodities, including market price fluctuations, regulatory changes, interest rate changes, credit risk, economic changes and the impact of adverse political or financial factors. Investing in Gold involves special risks, including market price fluctuations, regulatory changes, interest rate changes, credit risk, economic changes, and the impact of adverse political or financial factors.\n\nInvestments in Infrastructure Assets will be subject to risks incidental to owning and operating infrastructure projects, including risks associated with the general economic climate, geographic or market concentration, government regulations and fluctuations in interest rates. The industries targeted for investment may be highly regulated by governmental agencies. Such regulations may impact an investor’s ability to acquire, dispose of and/or manage investments."

        "content": "Alternative investments are intended for qualified investors only. Alternative Investments such as derivatives, hedge funds, private equity funds, and funds of funds can result in higher return potential but also higher loss potential. Changes in economic conditions or other circumstances may adversely affect your investments. Before you invest in alternative investments, you should consider your overall financial situation, how much money you have to invest, your need for liquidity, and your tolerance for risk.\nNonfinancial assets, such as closely-held businesses, real estate, fine art, oil, gas and mineral properties, and timber, farm and ranch land, are complex in nature and involve risks including total loss of value. Special risk considerations include natural events (for example, earthquakes or fires), complex tax considerations, and lack of liquidity. Nonfinancial assets are not in the best interest of all investors. Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager, and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax, or estate planning strategy.\nSustainable and Impact Investing and/or Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) managers may take into consideration factors beyond traditional financial information to select securities, which could result in relative investment performance deviating from other strategies or broad market benchmarks, depending on whether such sectors or investments are in or out of favor in the market. Further, ESG strategies may rely on certain values based criteria to eliminate exposures found in similar strategies or broad market benchmarks, which could also result in relative investment performance deviating."
