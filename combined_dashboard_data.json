However, for the first time since 1993, two governors on the monetary policy committee dissented in favor of a 0.75% cut. Amid intensifying debate, the central bank continues to take a patient approach to monetary policy. This has been due to heightened economic uncertainty regarding the resilience of the labor market and concerns about inflation. The market expects two Fed rate cuts this year.
